We want to find the repeats in a long sequence of numbers.
In particular, given an array of integers,
write a function that returns the set of values that appear more that once (in the input array).

Examples
Input: [1,3,4,3,2,1]
Expected output: [3,1] //note that order does not matter

Input: [1,1,1,2]
Expected output: [1]
